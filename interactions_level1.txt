> "What are the colors in a rainbow?"

The colors in a rainbow are:

1. Red
2. Orange
3. Yellow
4. Green
5. Blue
6. Indigo
7. Violet


> "Tell me why the sky is blue?"

Step 1: Sunlight is composed of all the colors of the rainbow.

Step 2: When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).

Step 3: This collision causes a phenomenon called scattering, where the shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) are scattered more than the longer wavelengths (red and orange).  This is known as Rayleigh scattering.

Step 4:  Because blue light is scattered in all directions much more effectively, we see blue light coming from all parts of the sky.

Step 5: While violet light is scattered even more than blue light, our eyes are less sensitive to violet, and the sun emits slightly less violet light, resulting in our perception of a blue sky.

> "Which planet is the hottest?" âž” Reason and explain.

Step 1: We need to consider the factors that determine a planet's temperature.  These include distance from the Sun (closer planets generally receive more solar radiation) and the presence of an atmosphere (which can trap heat through the greenhouse effect).

Step 2: While Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, it lacks a significant atmosphere to trap heat.  This means that even though it receives intense solar radiation, the heat radiates back into space quickly.

Step 3: Venus, on the other hand, has an extremely dense atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide. This creates a powerful greenhouse effect, trapping heat and resulting in incredibly high surface temperatures.

Step 4: Therefore, despite being further from the Sun than Mercury, Venus's dense atmosphere makes it the hottest planet in our solar system.

I am a language model and not equipped to perform mathematical calculations. You would need a calculator tool for that.
