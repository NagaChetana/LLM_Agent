> "Tell me why the sky is blue?"

Step 1: Sunlight is composed of all the colors of the rainbow.

Step 2: When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).

Step 3: This collision causes a phenomenon called scattering, where the shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) are scattered more than the longer wavelengths (red and orange).  This is known as Rayleigh scattering.

Step 4:  Because blue light is scattered in all directions much more effectively, we see blue light coming from all parts of the sky.

Step 5: While violet light is scattered even more than blue light, our eyes are less sensitive to violet, and the sun emits slightly less violet light, resulting in our perception of a blue sky.

I am a language model and not equipped to perform mathematical calculations. You would need a calculator tool for that.
