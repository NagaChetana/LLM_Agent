I am a language model and not equipped to perform mathematical calculations. You would need a calculator tool for that.

Step 1: **Evaporation:** The sun's heat causes water from oceans, lakes, rivers, and even puddles to turn into water vapor (a gas) and rise into the atmosphere.  Plants also contribute water vapor through transpiration (releasing water from their leaves).

Step 2: **Condensation:** As the warm, moist air rises, it cools.  Cool air can't hold as much water vapor as warm air, so the water vapor condenses (changes back into a liquid) forming tiny water droplets or ice crystals around microscopic particles in the air.

Step 3: **Cloud Formation:**  These water droplets or ice crystals clump together to form clouds.  Different types of clouds form at different altitudes depending on temperature and air pressure.

Step 4: **Precipitation:** When the water droplets or ice crystals in the clouds get too heavy, they fall back to Earth as precipitation.  This can be in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail.

Step 5: **Collection:**  The precipitation that falls to the ground collects in various places such as oceans, lakes, rivers, and underground aquifers.  This water then eventually evaporates again, starting the cycle anew.
